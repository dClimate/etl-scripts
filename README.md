This repository contains scripts that process ETLs of gridded datasets[^1] to an ipfs cluster.

[^1] A gridded dataset organizes data into cells on a grid. Each cell represents a specific area on the Earth's surface and contains values like temperature, precipitation, etc.

Read `README-dev.md` for how to setup your development environment.
Check out `repo-map.md` for information about what each directory holds.
