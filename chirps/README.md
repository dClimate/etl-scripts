# Datasets
The "p05"/"p25" suffix refers to the precision/width of the grid cells. Based on the fact that https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data states "CHIRPS incorporates 0.05Â° resolution satellite imagery", we assume that the p05 and p25 directory at https://data.chc.ucsb.edu/products/CHIRPS-2.0/global_daily/netcdf/ means a precision of 0.05 degrees and 0.25 degrees.

Final refers to finalized data, and prelim refers to data that may be changed by CHIRPS, but is closer to realtime values.
